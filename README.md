## Project Overview

PARETOGNN is a multi-task self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for graph neural networks (GNNs). It aims to dynamically reconcile multiple pretext tasks, enabling stronger task generalization for downstream applications.

### Key Features:
- **Multi-Task Learning**: Efficiently handles multiple self-supervised tasks to improve task generalization.
- **Dynamic Reconciliation**: Leverages Pareto optimization to balance competing objectives.
- **Graph-Based Framework**: Designed for tasks involving graph-structured data.
